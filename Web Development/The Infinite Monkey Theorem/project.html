    <h2>The Infinite Monkey Theorem </h2>
    <p class="paragraph1">The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys independently and at random on a typewriter keyboard for
    an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, including the complete works of William
    Shakespeare. More precisely, under the assumption of independence and randomness of each keystroke, the monkey would
    almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. The theorem can be generalized to state that
    any infinite sequence of independent events whose probabilities are uniformly bounded below by a positive number will
    almost surely have infinitely many occurrences.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph2">
        In this context, "almost surely" is a mathematical term meaning the event happens with probability 1, and the "monkey"
        is not an actual monkey, but a metaphor for an abstract device that produces an endless random sequence of letters and
        symbols. Variants of the theorem include multiple and even infinitely many independent typists, and the target text
        varies between an entire library and a single sentence.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph3">
        One of the earliest instances of the use of the "monkey metaphor" is that of French mathematician Émile Borel in 1913, but the first instance may have been even earlier. Jorge Luis Borges traced the history of this idea from Aristotle's On Generation and Corruption and Cicero's De Natura Deorum (On the Nature of the Gods), through Blaise Pascal and Jonathan Swift, up to modern statements with their iconic simians and typewriters. In the early 20th century, Borel and Arthur Eddington used the theorem to illustrate the timescales implicit in the foundations of statistical mechanics.
